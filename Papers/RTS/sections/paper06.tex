\section{Towards runtime adaptation in AUTOSAR}

\subsection{Key Idea}
Devise a flexible and efficient solution for runtime adaptation in AUTOSAR with minimal changes to the existing framework.
AUTOSAR provides a mode management mechanism to change predefined configuration of RTE, basic software components and network communication at runtime.
The main limitation being all configuration are defined statically.
New approach provides a mechanism to allow runtime adaptation by changing software component dynamically.
