\subsection{Design and analysis for Dual Priority Scheduling}
\subsubsection{Idea}
Hard Real-Time systems often employ priority driven preemptive scheduling for efficient usage of system resource. And in this context preemptive dynamic priority based Earliest Deadline First(EDF is known to be optimal for scheduling such tasks.
But approach in industry has been towards using Fixed priority scheduling due to its efficient runtime support. Multiple approaches have been considered to improve the schedulability under FP scheduling and one such approach is priority promotion based scheduling.
