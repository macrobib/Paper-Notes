Design and analysis for Dual Priority Scheduling
------------------------------------------------

### Idea

Hard Real-Time systems often employ priority driven preemptive
scheduling for efficient usage of system resource. And in this context
preemptive dynamic priority based Earliest Deadline First(EDF is known
to be optimal for scheduling such tasks. But approach in industry has
been towards using Fixed priority scheduling due to its efficient
runtime support. Multiple approaches have been considered to improve the
schedulability under FP scheduling and one such approach is priority
promotion based scheduling.
