### An Elastic Mixed-Criticality Task Model and Early-Release EDF Scheduling Algorithms
##### key Idea:
- Introduce early release point to EDF-VD to improve schedulability of low criticality tasks.
- Builds on Elastic scheduling model proposed by Buttazzo, which proposed the idea of variable period bounded by a maximum period, which is determined offline and provides minimum service for the task.
- Proposes conservative and aggressive early release approaches, and investigate application to Preference Oriented Earliest Deadline Scheduler.
