##### Preemptive Scheduling of Multi-Criticality Systems with Varying Degrees of Execution Time Assurance
- Brings the concept of supporting tasks of multiple criticality.
- Providing non uniform support for overrun detection and handling.
- One of the methods proposed is to do deadline monotonic priority ordering along with period transformation to provide adequate support for high criticality tasks,
- Another method proposed is to have Audsley's optimal priority assignment approach.
- Audsley's approach provides non exponential runtime to determine priority ordering to meet the criticality requirement.
- Pandya's Response time analysis is enhanced to provide support for criticality changes.
