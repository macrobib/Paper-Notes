#### SIFT Implementation and Optimization for Multi-Core Systems 

Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) is a common approach used in image matching with implications in object recognition and scene recognition.

##### What SIFT is:
- SIFT is an approach for detecting and extracting local feature descriptors from images. the major computation stages used to generate the set of image features are: Building Gaussian scale space, Keypoint detection and localization, Orientation assignment, and Keypoint descriptor. Figure below shows the flow.
