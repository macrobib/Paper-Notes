#### PixelNet: Representation of the pixels, by the pixels, and for the pixels.

- Explores the design principles of general pixel-level prediction problems, from low-level edge detection to mid-level surface normal estimation to high-level semantic segmentation.
- Vision problems can be formulated as: low-level, medium-level, high-level.
- low-level: Edge detection and optical flow.
- medium-level: depth/normal recovery.
- high-level: keypoint prediction, object detection and semantic segmentation.
